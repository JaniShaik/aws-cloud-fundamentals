# AWS Cloud Fundamentals

This repository documents my foundational learning of AWS Cloud infrastructure as part of my journey toward architect-level cloud engineering.

Understanding AWS fundamentals is critical before designing scalable, highly available production systems.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository focuses on:

- AWS history and evolution
- AWS global infrastructure design
- Regions and Availability Zones
- Edge locations and global networking
- Architectural decision factors

These fundamentals form the foundation for building distributed and scalable systems.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ AWS History
Understanding how AWS evolved helps explain why cloud infrastructure is designed the way it is today.

- Internal launch (2002)
- Public services (SQS, S3, EC2)
- Global expansion
- Market leadership

### 2️⃣ AWS Global Infrastructure

Deep dive into:

- Regions
- Availability Zones (AZs)
- Data Centers
- Edge Locations
- Global vs Region-scoped services
- Region selection strategy

## 🏗 Architectural Perspective

Before deploying workloads to AWS, every architect should understand:

- How regions affect latency and compliance
- How multi-AZ design enables high availability
- How edge locations improve global performance
- Which services are global vs region-scoped

These concepts directly impact production architecture decisions.

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Modern cloud systems require:

- High availability
- Fault tolerance
- Low latency
- Global scalability

AWS infrastructure is built to support these principles by design.

Mastering these fundamentals is the first step toward architect-level thinking.
