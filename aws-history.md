# AWS History – The Foundation of Modern Cloud Computing

Understanding AWS history is important because it explains *why* AWS is architected the way it is today.

AWS was not created as a product first — it was built to solve Amazon’s internal scaling challenges.

---

## Early Evolution

### 2002 – Internal Launch
AWS services were launched internally inside Amazon to support their rapidly growing infrastructure needs.

### 2003 – Strategic Realization
Amazon recognized infrastructure as a core strength and decided to commercialize it.

The idea:  
Provide scalable infrastructure as a service to developers worldwide.

---

## Public Launch Phase

### 2004 – First Public Service
Amazon launched:
- **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**

This was one of the earliest managed messaging services.

---

### 2006 – Major Public Relaunch

AWS officially relaunched with:

- SQS
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

This marked the true beginning of cloud computing at scale.

These services introduced:

- On-demand compute
- Pay-as-you-go storage
- Elastic scalability

---

### 2007 – Global Expansion

AWS expanded into Europe.

This marked the beginning of AWS global infrastructure strategy.

---

## AWS Market Position (2023–2024)

- $90 Billion revenue in 2023
- 31% global cloud market share (Q1 2024)
- Leader for 13 consecutive years
- 1,000,000+ active users

---

## Why AWS History Matters for Architects

AWS was built around solving:

- Scalability challenges
- Infrastructure automation
- Global distribution
- Cost optimization

Understanding this explains:

- Why regions and availability zones exist
- Why services are region-scoped
- Why scalability is built-in

AWS history is directly connected to modern cloud architecture design principles.

## Key Insight

AWS didn’t invent the cloud.

It operationalized scalability.

That is why understanding its foundations is critical before designing production-grade systems.
